# JDPluginManager

## Overview

Are you using a lot of XCode Plugins?

This plugin will give you an overview of all installed Plugins. With it you can easily open their directories, uninstall plugins or even install new ones from a github repository - everything happens directly out of Xcode.  
*This is tested only on OS X 10.8 with Xcode 4.6.*

It adds a new MenuItem "Plugins" in the Menu Bar of Xcode:

## Installation

Simply build this Xcode project once and restart Xcode. You can delete the project afterwards. (The plugin will be copied to your system automatically after the build.)

If you get a "Permission Denied" error while building, please see [this issue](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode/issues/1) of the great [ColorSense plugin](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode/).


## Uninstall

In Xcode, go to *Plugins > JDPluginManager > Uninstall* and restart Xcode afterwards.
