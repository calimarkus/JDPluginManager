## Installation

Simply build this Xcode project once and restart Xcode. You can delete the project afterwards. (The plugin will be copied to your system automatically after the build.)

If you get a "Permission Denied" error while building, please see [this issue](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode/issues/1) of the great [ColorSense plugin](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode/).


## Uninstall

In Xcode, go to *Plugins > JDPluginManager > Uninstall* and restart Xcode afterwards.
